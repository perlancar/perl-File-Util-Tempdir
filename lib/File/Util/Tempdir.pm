# ABSTRACT: Cross-platform way to get system-wide & user private temporary directory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use File::Util::Tempdir qw(get_tempdir get_user_tempdir);

 my $tmpdir = get_tempdir(); # => e.g. "/tmp"

 my $mytmpdir = get_tempdir(); # => e.g. "/run/user/1000", or "/tmp/1000"


=head1 DESCRIPTION


=head1 FUNCTIONS

None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

=head2 get_tempdir

Usage:

 my $dir = get_tempdir();

A cross-platform way to get system-wide temporary directory.

On Windows: it first looks for one of these environment variables in this order
and return the first value that is set: C<TMP>, C<TEMP>, C<TMPDIR>, C<TEMPDIR>.
If none are set, will look at these directories in this order and return the
first value that is set: C<C:\TMP>, C<C:\TEMP>. If none are set, will die.

On Unix: it first looks for one of these environment variables in this order and
return the first value that is set: C<TMPDIR>, C<TEMPDIR>, C<TMP>, C<TEMP>. If
none are set, will look at these directories in this order and return the first
value that is set: C</tmp>, C</var/tmp>. If none are set, will die.

=head2 get_user_tempdir

Usage:

 my $dir = get_user_tempdir();

Get user's private temporary directory.

When you use world-writable temporary directory like F</tmp>, you usually need
to create randomly named temporary files, such as those created by
L<File::Temp>. If you try to create a temporary file with guessable name, other
users can intercept this and you can either: 1) fail to create/write your
temporary file; 2) be tricked to read malicious data; 3) be tricked to write to
other location (e.g. via symlink).

This routine is like L</"get_tempdir"> except: on Unix, it will look for
C<XDG_RUNTIME_DIR> first (which on a Linux system with systemd will have value
like C</run/user/1000> which points to a RAM-based tmpfs). Also,
C<get_user_tempdir> will first check that the temporary directory is: 1) owned
by the running user; 2) not group- and world-writable. If not, it will create a
subdirectory named C<$EUID> (C<< $> >>) with permission mode 0700 and return
that. If that subdirectory already exists and is not owned by the user, will try
C<$EUID.1> and so on.

It will die on failure.


=head1 SEE ALSO

L<File::Spec> has C<tmpdir> function. It also tries to look at environment
variables, e.g. on Unix it will look at C<TMPDIR> (but not C<TEMPDIR>) and
then falls back to C</tmp> (but not C</var/tmp>).

L<File::HomeDir>, a cross-platform way to get user's home directory and a few
other related directories.

L<File::Temp> to create a temporary directory.

L<https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>
for the specification of C<XDG_RUNTIME_DIR>.
